Large-scale models play a key role in determining long range flow pathways from continental interiors to the oceans, yet struggle to simulate the local flow patterns offered by small-scale models. We have developed a highly scalable numerical framework to model continental groundwater flow which capture the intricate flow pathways between deep aquifers and the near-surface. The coupled thermal-hydraulic basin structure is inferred from hydraulic head measurements, recharge estimates from geochemical proxies, and borehole temperature data using a Bayesian framework. We use it to model the deep groundwater flow beneath the Sydney\u2013Gunnedah\u2013Bowen Basin, part of Australia\u2019s largest aquifer system. Coastal aquifers have flow rates of up to 0.3\u00a0m/day, and a corresponding groundwater residence time of just 2,000\u00a0years. In contrast, our model predicts slow flow rates of 0.005\u00a0m/day for inland aquifers, resulting in a groundwater residence time of <jats:inline-formula><jats:alternatives><jats:tex-math>$$\\sim $$</jats:tex-math><mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n                  <mml:mo>\u223c</mml:mo>\n                </mml:math></jats:alternatives></jats:inline-formula>\u00a0400,000 years.
